            <h4 style="color:Fuchsia">The Sentinel of Mind, The Luminary</h4>
            <pre><b>Element:</b> Mind
<b>Color:</b> Purple
<b>Patron to:</b> Students, Monks, Therapists, Mentally Ill Creatures, Transgender Creatures
<b>Associated Season:</b> None, see below
<b>Personality:</b> Social, Enigmatic, Compassionate
<b>Common Pronouns:</b> she/her
<b>Sacred Land:</b> Sapphidel (the city)
<b>Other Information:</b> </pre>
            <ul>
            <li>Her most popular depiction blends elements from cats, birds and gems. She is depicted with a halo of swirling psychic energy.</li>
            <li>In recent years, she and <a href="/godsandspirits/sentinels/jaquara">Jaquara</a> have been claimed to be patron to transgender creatures, due to their connection to the healing elements (which are often used in transitions).</li>
            <li>Her title comes from her drive to enlighten others and encourage them to be their best self.</li>
            <li>She is not associated with any one season but “liminal times” such as the last and first days of the year, solstices and equinoxes.</li>
			      <li>Sapphidel is notable for being the Sentinel to interact with Saturnians the most, even after their hibernation. It’s also notable she’s the “rebel” of the group, often opposing the other Sentinels and going behind their backs. It’s theorized this is why there is no 13th month and why she is only honored in the liminal times.</li>
            </ul>
