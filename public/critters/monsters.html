            <h2>Monsters</h2>

            <p>Not all is fun and games in the wilderness of the world. Monsters are not uncommon and can be quite dangerous—though not always. They are characterized by their often bestial appearance and violent behavior. They can be hunted for resources, food or sometimes just glory. Some believe some monsters were former creatures changed by magical corruption.</p>
